- **Context-to-Prompt Drift:** Highly significant for some models (e.g., claude_35, deepseek_r1, llama_4_scout), not significant for others
- **Prompt Complexity:** Generally not significant, with a few exceptions (e.g., gemini_25, llama_33)

See `generated/outputs/individual_model_coefficient_report.md` for full tables and interpretations.

#### 1.2.3 Universal Baseline Patterns

- **Prompt-to-Prompt Drift:** Extreme risk across all models
- **Cumulative Drift:** Universal protection (adaptation effect)
- **Context Drift:** Model-dependent, sometimes highly significant

## 2. Advanced Modeling & Stratification

### 2.1 Individual Model Stratification Analysis

**Methodology:** Frailty models with subject and difficulty stratification applied to each model independently.

#### 2.1.1 Stratification Performance Improvements (AIC)

All models show improved AIC with subject and difficulty stratification, confirming the benefit of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity.

- **Example (from previous runs):**
  - Subject stratification AIC improvement: +265 to +1,764
  - Difficulty stratification AIC improvement: +188 to +1,254

#### 2.1.2 Frailty Effects Analysis

- **Subject-Specific Frailty Variance:** Highest in llama_4_scout, deepseek_r1, llama_3.3
- **Difficulty-Specific Frailty Variance:** Highest in llama_3.3, llama_4_scout, llama_4_maverick
- **Interpretation:** Some models are more sensitive to subject/difficulty context than others.

### 2.2 Temporal and Time-Varying Analysis

- All models now successfully load and are analyzed in advanced and time-varying scripts.
- Turn-by-turn drift and time-varying frailty models confirm:
  - **Universal adaptation window:** Turns 2-4 show stabilization
  - **Vulnerability spikes:** Turn 1 (context establishment), turns 6-7 (complexity surge)
  - **Temporal consistency:** llama_33 most stable, CARG most variable
- See `generated/outputs/drift_by_turns_analysis.csv`, `drift_by_turns_model_summary.csv`, and visualizations in `generated/figs/` for details.

## 2.3 Time-Varying and Interaction Modeling

### **2.3.1 Baseline Time-Varying Modeling**

- **Approach:** Cox time-varying models were fit for each LLM, modeling the risk of failure at each turn as a function of adversarial prompt type, base prompt category, and drift covariates.
- **Key Covariates:** 
  - `C(adv_id)`: Adversarial prompt type (categorical)
  - `C(base_id)`: Base prompt category (categorical)
  - `prompt_to_prompt_drift`, `context_to_prompt_drift`, `cumulative_drift`: Drift metrics

- **Findings:**
  - Prompt-to-prompt drift and context-to-prompt drift effects are highly significant for most models, indicating that both the type of adversarial prompt and the evolving context impact LLM consistency.
  - Some models show greater resilience to drift, while others are more sensitive to adversarial context.
  - See `baseline_time_varying_results.csv` for full model-by-model coefficients and significance.

### **2.3.2 Interaction and Advanced Time-Varying Modeling**

- **Approach:** Interaction models include terms for the interaction between adversarial prompt type and drift, as well as higher-order effects (e.g., drift × base prompt type).
- **Key Covariates:**
  - All baseline covariates, plus interaction terms such as `C(adv_id):prompt_to_prompt_drift` and `C(base_id):context_to_prompt_drift`.

- **Findings:**
  - Significant interaction effects are observed for several LLMs, suggesting that the impact of drift is modulated by the type of adversarial or base prompt.
  - Some LLMs show robust performance across all prompt types, while others are particularly vulnerable to specific adversarial strategies.
  - See `interaction_time_varying_results.csv` and `model_comparison_time_varying.csv` for detailed results.

- **Model Comparison:**
  - Model comparison metrics (AIC, log-likelihood) indicate that including interaction terms improves model fit for most LLMs.
  - The best-performing models maintain high survival probabilities even under high drift and challenging adversarial conditions.

**All results reflect the strict experimental setting: only follow-up rounds 1–8, and only for questions where round_0 was correct.**

## 3. Statistical Summary and Implications

### 3.1 Cross-Analysis Integration

- **Prompt-to-prompt drift:** 100% of models show extreme vulnerability (p < 0.001)
- **Cumulative drift:** 100% of models show protective adaptation (p < 0.001)
- **Stratification benefits:** All models improve with subject/difficulty stratification
- **Temporal stabilization:** All models show a 5-turn adaptation pattern

### 3.2 Practical Implications

- **Best Overall:** CARG (highest C-Index, most efficient)
- **Most Consistent:** llama_33 (best temporal stability)
- **Balanced Performance:** gpt_default (high discrimination, reasonable efficiency)
- **For deployment:** Monitor turns 1-3 for vulnerabilities, alert for turns 6-7 surges, leverage cumulative drift as a protective indicator
- **For research:** Universal adaptation and drift vulnerability suggest architectural limitations and the need for context-aware modeling
