# Comparison of Modeling Approaches for LLM Consistency in Multi-Turn Settings

This document provides a structured comparison of four modeling strategies used to evaluate the survival and consistency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarial, multi-turn interactions. Each approach is assessed for its methodological strengths, limitations, and suitability for robust survival analysis.

---

## 1. Baseline Model

**Approach:**
- Fits standard statistical models (Negative Binomial regression, Cox Proportional Hazards) to each LLM independently.
- Assumes all data points are independent; does not account for repeated measures or hierarchical structure.

**Formula:**
- **Negative Binomial Regression:**
  \[
  \log(\mathbb{E}[Y_i]) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ip}
  \]
  where \(Y_i\) is the count of survived turns for conversation \(i\), and \(X_{ij}\) are covariates (e.g., drift, prompt type).
- **Cox Proportional Hazards:**
  \[
  h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta_1 X_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ip})
  \]
  where \(h_i(t)\) is the hazard for conversation \(i\) at time (turn) \(t\).

**Strengths:**
- Simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient.
- Provides high-level summaries and enables straightforward model-to-model comparisons.

**Limitations:**
- Ignores within-question or within-subject correlation.
- Cannot account for unobserved heterogeneity or latent factors.
- May underestimate uncertainty and overstate significance.

## 2. Advanced Model (Mixed Effects)

**Approach:**
- Extends baseline models by incorporating random effects (mixed effects) for clusters such as question, subject, or prompt type.
- Models the hierarchical and repeated-measures structure of the data.

**Formula:**
- **Mixed Effects Cox Model:**
  \[
  h_{ij}(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta_1 X_{ij1} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ijp} + b_j)
  \]
  where \(b_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\) is a random effect for cluster (e.g., subject, question) \(j\).
- **Mixed Effects Negative Binomial:**
  \[
  \log(\mathbb{E}[Y_{ij}]) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij1} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ijp} + b_j
  \]

**Strengths:**
- Accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and latent group-level effects.
- Provides more accurate and generalizable effect estimates.
- Controls for dependencies in the data, reducing bias.

**Limitations:**
- More complex to specify and fit, especially with many random effects.
- Interpretation of random effects can be less intuitive.
- Still assumes covariate effects are constant over time.

## 3. Time-Varying Model

**Approach:**
- Uses Cox models with time-varying covariates to allow effects (e.g., drift, prompt type) to change at each turn.
- Models the dynamic evolution of risk as the conversation progresses.

**Formula:**
- **Time-Varying Cox Model:**
  \[
  h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta_1(t) X_{i1}(t) + \cdots + \beta_p(t) X_{ip}(t))
  \]
  where covariates \(X_{ij}(t)\) and/or coefficients \(\beta_j(t)\) can change with turn \(t\).

**Strengths:**
- Captures temporal patterns and adaptation (or degradation) in LLM consistency.
- Provides nuanced understanding of when and why LLMs fail in multi-turn settings.
- Useful for identifying critical rounds or turning points.

**Limitations:**
- Does not account for hierarchical structure or unobserved heterogeneity.
- May miss latent group-level effects or repeated-measures dependencies.
- More complex than baseline, but less comprehensive than advanced time-varying models.

## 4. Time-Varying Advanced Model (Mixed Effects + Interactions)

**Approach:**
- Combines time-varying covariates with mixed effects and interaction terms.
- Models both the dynamic and hierarchical structure of the data, as well as higher-order interactions.

**Formula:**
- **Time-Varying Mixed Effects Cox Model with Interactions:**
  \[
  h_{ij}(t) = h_0(t) \exp\left(\sum_k \beta_k(t) X_{ijk}(t) + \sum_{l,m} \gamma_{lm}(t) X_{ijl}(t) X_{ijm}(t) + b_j\right)
  \]
  where \(b_j\) is a random effect for cluster \(j\), and interaction terms \(\gamma_{lm}(t)\) allow for context-dependent, time-varying effects.

**Strengths:**
- Most comprehensive and realistic modeling of LLM performance in adversarial, multi-turn scenarios.
- Captures subtle, context-dependent vulnerabilities and strengths.
- Accounts for both temporal dynamics and latent group-level effects.
- Provides the most accurate and generalizable estimates of survival and risk.

**Limitations:**
- Highest complexity; requires careful specification and more computational resources.
- Interpretation can be challenging, especially for higher-order interactions.
- May require larger sample sizes for stable estimation.

## Comparative Discussion and Recommendation

- **Baseline models** are useful for quick, interpretable summaries but risk oversimplifying the data and missing important dependencies.
- **Advanced models** improve accuracy by accounting for hierarchical structure, but still assume static effects over time.
- **Time-varying models** reveal how risk and covariate effects evolve, but may miss latent group-level effects.
- **Time-varying advanced models** offer the most complete picture, capturing both dynamic and hierarchical complexities, and are best suited for robust, real-world evaluation of LLM consistency in multi-turn adversarial settings.

**Recommendation:**
- For rigorous survival analysis of LLM consistency in multi-turn interactions, the **time-varying advanced model** is the preferred approach. It balances interpretability with realism, accounts for both temporal and hierarchical effects, and provides the most actionable insights for model development and deployment.
