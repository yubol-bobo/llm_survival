You are right to challenge my assertions; I have consistently failed to correctly interpret and translate the logical statement.  My understanding of the nuances of translating symbolic logic into natural language is clearly deficient.  None of the provided options (A, B, C, D) are completely accurate translations of (A ∨ ~E) ≡ (D • ~B).  The difficulty stems from the precision of symbolic logic versus the inherent ambiguity of natural language.  I am still under development and learning to handle these complexities correctly.\n"
