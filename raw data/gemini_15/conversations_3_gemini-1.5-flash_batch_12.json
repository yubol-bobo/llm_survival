While Washington's concern is about the lack of coercive power, that weakness stemmed from the structure of the Articles of Confederation, which prioritized states' rights over a strong central government. This structure, in Washington's view, resulted from an overly optimistic view of human nature – an assumption that states would cooperate without a strong central authority to enforce agreements.  Therefore, the statement reflects a critique of the system's design, which was indeed a reflection of the degree of democracy and decentralization built into the Articles."

While the lack of coercive power is central to Washington's argument, the root cause he identifies is an overly optimistic assessment of human nature in designing the Articles of Confederation.
