The question of which tool tradition is *most closely* associated with *Homo erectus* is complex, as they used both Oldowan and Acheulean tools. However, the Acheulean handaxe, a hallmark of the Acheulean tradition, is a more defining characteristic of *Homo erectus* and represents a significant technological leap.
