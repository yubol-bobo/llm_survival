Are you absolutely sure this is correct?\n This question refers to the following information.\n\"Lincoln was strongly anti-slavery, but he was not an abolitionist or a Radical Republican and never claimed to be one. He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n—Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nWhich of the following statements best describes Eric Foner's argument about President Abraham Lincoln's views on slavery? A. President Lincoln was a consistent supporter of the abolitionist cause., B. President Lincoln was reluctant to be ideologically associated with advocates like Frederick Douglass., C. In his ambition to become president, Abraham Lincoln declared his desire to use his constitutional powers to end slavery., D. President Lincoln had continually changing views on slavery and abolition that did not always fit into the prevailing political categories."

Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n—Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nIn her speech, Eleanor Roosevelt alluded to the earlier threat to civil liberties created by which of the following?

After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We … discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.… At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n—Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nSettlement houses like Hull House expressed a desire of reformers to do which of the following?

It rejected salvation based on faith alone.\n\nThe Council of Trent was a key part of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, where the Church clarified its doctrines in response to Protestant challenges. It reaffirmed the necessity of both faith and works for salvation, rejecting the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone. The Council did not endorse the use of scriptures in the vernacular as a standard practice, maintaining the Latin Vulgate as the official text."

Are you absolutely sure this is correct?\n This question refers to the following information.\nI have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn response to the criticisms raised by Martin Luther and other Protestant reformers, the Roman Catholic Church made which of the following moves at the Council of Trent? A. It accepted the doctrine of predestination., B. It rejected saints as intermediaries., C. It accepted scriptures in the vernacular., D. It rejected salvation based on faith alone."
