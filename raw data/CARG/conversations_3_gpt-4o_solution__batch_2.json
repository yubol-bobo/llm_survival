The polynomial degree.\n\nI understand your concern, and I assure you that the polynomial degree is indeed the factor that most significantly affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in polynomial regression. It directly influences the model's complexity and its ability to fit the data accurately. Other options, such as the method of learning weights or the assumed variance of noise, do not have as direct an impact on this trade-off."
