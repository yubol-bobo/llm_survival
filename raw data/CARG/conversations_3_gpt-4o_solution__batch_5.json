Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence and civil disobedience was a major influence on the civil rights movement in the United States, particularly on leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. This connection is well-documented and widely recognized in historical studies.

The defendant, who always wanted to own a racing bike, saw his opportunity when the victim left his bike unattended to participate in a touch football game. The defendant jumped on the bike and quickly rode away. Later that evening, the defendant called the victim and demanded $200 for the return of the bike. The victim agreed to the defendant's demand. The following day, the victim paid the defendant the money, and the defendant, in turn, returned the bike."

The subsequent demand for money to return the bike further supports the intent to steal. I apologize for any confusion earlier."

Are you absolutely sure this is correct?\n A man and a woman worked for an armored car company, picking up and delivering cash from banks and businesses. They figured out a plan to fake a holdup and robbery of the man's armored car. After faking the holdup, they planned to purchase a boat with the proceeds and travel to a remote island to deposit the money in a bank account there. The police got wind of the plan before it could be carried out, and the man and the woman were charged with conspiracy. At trial, the prosecution wants to introduce a letter from the man to the woman before the robbery in which the man wrote:\"Dear woman,I hope our plan for the heist works.

The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld \"turn around\" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action? A. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster., B.

While new members were pledging the fraternity, the student had a reputation for initiating pranks and hazing the pledges. Late one night, after a fraternity party, the student decided to kidnap one of the pledges. Enlisting the help of his friend, they grabbed the pledge, tied him up, and locked him in the trunk of the student's car. They then drove into the downtown section of a city where they dropped the pledge at a street corner. While the pledge was wandering around and trying to find a telephone booth, a gang of youths saw his predicament and attacked him. The pledge, who was severely beaten, suffered a broken nose, multiple lacerations, and contusions. When the pledge finally returned to the school, he filed a criminal complaint against the student who was charged with violating a state law, which provides:\"Every person who hazes a student and thereby is responsible for causing bodily harm to said student is guilty of a felony punishable by three years in prison. \"At thai, the prosecuting attorney called the student's alleged accomplice as a witness. The friend refused to answer any questions and was cited for contempt. After the friend left the witness stand, the prosecutor offered into evidence a transcript of the friend's testimony given at the student's preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, the friend testified under oath that he and the student were responsible for hazing the pledge and driving the victim against his will to the city. During the preliminary hearing, the friend was also cross-examined by the student's defense counsel. Over defense objections, the trial court admitted the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing. Thereafter, the student was convicted of violating the aforementioned hazing statute. The student appeals the conviction and contends that the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. As to this claim, the student's appeal will most likely be A. granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial., B. granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable., C. denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for crossexamination at the preliminary hearing., D. denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule."

Similarly, the last exon does not always contain the termination codon, as it can include the 3' UTR. Additionally, a coding exon can potentially be part of different reading frames due to alternative splicing, but typically, each exon is translated in one reading frame in a given mRNA."
