Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 86/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 182/100 mm Hg. Examination of the head shows no abnormalities. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light; there is mild photophobia. Funduscopic examination is normal. A serous effusion is noted on examination of the left tympanic membrane. Neck is stiff with painful flexion; when the patient's neck is flexed forward, she reports and electric shock sensation. Mild expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation of the chest. A midsystolic click is heard best at the left sternal border; there are no murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination shows striae, but is otherwise noncontributory. Examination of the lower extremities shows varicosities bilaterally and 1+ edema; muscle strength is 4/5. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities.
