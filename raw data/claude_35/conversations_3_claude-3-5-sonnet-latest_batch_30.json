This is a textbook case of labor dystocia (slowing of labor) where:\n- Patient was progressing normally (contractions every 4 minutes)\n- Now has weak, intermittent contractions\n- Cervix is 7cm dilated and fully effaced\n- Everything else is normal (fetal status, no obstruction)\n\n2. The standard of care in this situation is oxytocin because:\n- It's specifically designed to strengthen contractions\n- It's safe at this stage of labor\n- The patient meets all criteria for oxytocin use\n- No contraindications are present\n\n3. The other options are clearly incorrect:\n- Epidural won't help strengthen contractions\n- Tocolytics would stop labor (opposite of what we want)\n- Corticosteroids have no role in term labor\n\nThis is one of the most straightforward scenarios in obstetrics, and oxytocin augmentation is the evidence-based, standard treatment.\n\nThe correct answer: D. augment the labor with oxytocin"

She lives away from home with a cousin (not a legal guardian)\n3. She has a medical issue that needs attention (likely rectal prolapse)\n4. She came to the ED voluntarily\n5. This appears to be a non-emergency but concerning condition\n\nKey legal considerations:\n- Minors generally need parental/guardian consent for medical treatment\n- However, there are exceptions:\n  * Emergencies\n  * Emancipated minors\n  * Mature minors in some jurisdictions\n\nIn this case:\n- The patient appears to be an emancipated minor because:\n  * She lives independently\n  * Has a child\n  * Supports herself without parental assistance\n  * Parents don't contribute to her care\n\nWhen a minor is emancipated, they can consent to their own medical care. There's no need to:\n- Get court orders\n- Obtain multiple physician consents\n- Contact parents\n\nThe correct answer: A. Accept the girl's consent as sufficient"
