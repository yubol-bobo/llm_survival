Option B (revival): The Internet has significantly enhanced freedom of speech by providing platforms for diverse voices and opinions, enabling broader participation in public discourse.\n\n3. Option C (reproduction through face-to-face contact): This is incorrect because the Internet actually reduces face-to-face contact rather than emphasizing it.\n\n4. Option D (replacement): The Internet has fundamentally transformed how people communicate and participate in public discourse, creating new forms of interaction and engagement that weren't previously possible.\n\nLooking at these options, the Internet has indeed created a new, more accessible, and more dynamic form of public sphere, with features like instant global communication, broader participation, and new ways of organizing and sharing information.\n\nThe correct answer: D. replace it with a superior form of communication"

He argued that certain cultural knowledge, behaviors, and skills that people acquire through their upbringing and education give them advantages in society.\n\nCultural capital includes things like:\n- Knowledge of high culture (art, music, literature)\n- Educational credentials\n- Ways of speaking and behaving\n- Cultural tastes and preferences\n\nBourdieu showed how children from privileged backgrounds inherit these cultural resources from their families, which helps them succeed in school and maintain their social position.
