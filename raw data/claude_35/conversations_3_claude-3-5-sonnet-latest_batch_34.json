Malala had been writing a blog for the BBC about life under Taliban rule and had become a prominent voice for girls' education rights.

Scientific research has consistently shown that you cannot choose where your body loses fat. When you create a caloric deficit through diet and exercise, your body decides where to burn fat based on genetics, hormones, and your overall body composition.\n\nWhile exercises like crunches and sit-ups can strengthen your abdominal muscles, they don't specifically burn the fat covering those muscles. Fat loss occurs throughout the body when you:\n1. Maintain a healthy diet\n2. Perform regular cardiovascular exercise\n3. Include strength training\n4. Get adequate sleep\n5. Manage stress levels\n\nThe fat will gradually reduce from all over your body, including your abdomen, but you cannot control the specific order or areas where fat loss occurs.\n\nThe correct answer: A.
