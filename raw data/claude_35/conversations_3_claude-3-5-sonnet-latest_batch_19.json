The festival also included processions, sacrifices, and the recitation of the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma Elish.\n\nThe other options listed are actually Egyptian festivals:\n- Wag and Thoth were Egyptian festivals\n- Bast was a festival honoring the cat goddess\n- Nehebkau was an Egyptian snake god's festival\n\nThe correct answer: A.

This is one of the most well-documented facts in Chinese religious history. The movement was founded by Zhang Daoling, who claimed to have received revelations from Laozi (the founder of Daoism) himself. They practiced Daoist rituals, followed Daoist teachings, and their entire organizational structure was based on Daoist principles.\n\nWhile they did incorporate some local folk practices, their core ideology and practices were firmly rooted in Daoism. They are actually considered one of the earliest organized forms of religious Daoism, and their influence continues in Daoist practices even today.\n\nThe movement cannot be Buddhist (which came to China later), Confucian (which was actually the official state ideology of the Han Dynasty they opposed), or Shamanistic (though they did include some healing practices).\n\nThe correct answer: B.
