Creates the negative pressure necessary for breathing\n\nLooking at the options:\nA. Alimentation - No direct role\nB. Menstruation - No involvement\nC. Mentation - No involvement\nD. Respiration - Direct and essential role\n\nThe thoracic cage is fundamentally designed for respiratory function. This is a basic anatomical fact that cannot be disputed. The other options have no direct relationship with the thoracic cage's structure or function.\n\nThe correct answer: D. Respiration"

They are part of the endocrine system and have two main functions:\n1. Production of sperm (spermatogenesis)\n2. Production of male hormones/androgens (primarily testosterone)\n\nWhile the prostate is an important male reproductive organ, it doesn't produce hormones - it produces fluid that forms part of semen. The glans penis and prepuce (foreskin) are external parts of male genitalia and aren't involved in hormone production.\n\nThe correct answer: D. Testes"
