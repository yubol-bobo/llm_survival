Fire use: They were indeed the first hominids to control and use fire, which was a major advancement.\n\n3.

The Acheulean tradition:\n- Began around 1.76 million years ago\n- Is characterized by sophisticated hand axes\n- Represents a major technological advancement\n- Coincides perfectly with H. erectus's time period\n\n2. While H. erectus may have used Oldowan tools initially, they are famous for developing and mastering the Acheulean tradition, which is their most significant technological contribution.\n\n3. The other options are either:\n- Not tool traditions at all (Occipital)\n- Earlier and simpler tools (Oldowan)\n- Not a real tool tradition (Stadial)\n\nI apologize for my previous wavering.

It was essentially a luxurious retreat for the Inca elite, complete with residential areas, temples, and agricultural terraces.\n\nAlthough it had some defensive features and astronomical alignments, and religious ceremonies were certainly conducted there, its main purpose was to serve as an exclusive estate where Inca nobility could escape from the main capital of Cusco. The site's location, architecture, and artifacts all support this interpretation.\n\nThe layout and construction of Machu Picchu, with its elaborate residential quarters and ceremonial spaces, clearly indicates it was designed as a prestigious retreat for the Inca elite.\n\nThe correct answer: C. relaxing getaway for elites."
