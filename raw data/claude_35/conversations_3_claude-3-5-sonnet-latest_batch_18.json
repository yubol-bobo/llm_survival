Current HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) work by:\n- Blocking viral replication\n- Preventing virus entry into cells\n- Interfering with various stages of the viral life cycle\n\n2. Key limitations:\n- HIV can integrate its DNA into host cell DNA\n- Once integrated, the viral DNA can remain dormant\n- This integrated viral DNA can later be transcribed to produce new viruses\n\n3. The main issue:\n- Even if drugs suppress viral replication effectively\n- They cannot remove or affect the already integrated viral DNA\n- This integrated DNA serves as a permanent viral reservoir\n\n4. This means:\n- As long as integrated viral DNA exists\n- The virus can potentially become active again\n- Complete elimination (cure) is not possible with current drugs\n\nThe correct answer: C. They cannot block viral transcription from integrated viral DNA"
