The logical flow is:\n- Conclusion: Utilitarianism is embarrassed by utility monsters\n- Supporting evidence: What utility monsters do\n- More evidence: How they gain more utility than others lose\n- Final evidence: The problematic implication of sacrifice\n\nNow I can say with absolute certainty:\n\nThe correct answer: A.
