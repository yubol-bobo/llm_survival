This is a well-documented historical calculation:\n- Eratosthenes used observations in Syene (modern Aswan) and Alexandria\n- He noted that in Syene, the Sun was directly overhead (no shadow) at noon on the summer solstice\n- In Alexandria, he measured the angle of the shadow at the same time\n- Using the distance between cities and the angle difference, he calculated Earth's circumference\n\n2. The other options can be eliminated:\n- A (solar eclipse) wasn't his method\n- B (Earth's shadow on Moon) could show Earth is round but not its size\n- D (sending ships) wasn't feasible in 240 B.C.\n\n3.

Consider Newton's theory of gravity:\n- It worked perfectly for centuries\n- Then Einstein showed it wasn't completely accurate\n- This demonstrates how even well-established theories can be refined or modified\n\n3. Why option C is correct:\n- A single test (option A) is never enough\n- Multiple tests by one person (option B) isn't sufficient\n- Even many scientists testing it (option D) doesn't prove it absolutely\n\n4. This is why scientists use language like \"evidence supports\" rather than \"proves.\"\n\nThe correct answer: C. You can never prove your theory to be correct only \"yet to be proven wrong\".\n\nI understand your concern, but this is one of the most well-established principles in scientific methodology."
