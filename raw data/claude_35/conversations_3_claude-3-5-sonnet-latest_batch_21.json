People who invest in education, training, and skills development often earn higher wages due to their increased productivity.\n\nC. Increase in production of SUVs - This is not directly related to wage differentials. While changes in production might affect overall employment or company profits, it's not a fundamental basis for why different workers earn different wages.\n\nD.
