Here's why:\n\n1. When effluent comes into contact with the skin, it can be very irritating due to its acidic or alkaline nature\n2. Prolonged exposure to moisture and digestive enzymes in the effluent can break down the skin barrier\n3. This leads to inflammation, redness, pain, and damage to the skin\n\nThe other options actually help prevent skin excoriation:\n- A well-fitting pouch prevents leakage\n- Regular pouch changes maintain skin health\n- Using unscented soap is gentle on the skin\n\nThe correct answer: C.

This is found in every basic genetics textbook and is part of the core terminology of genetics:\n   - Dominant alleles = expressed when present\n   - Recessive alleles = masked when a dominant allele is present\n\n3.

This is not a tricky question but rather a straightforward test of basic genetic terminology.\n\nThe correct answer: A. recessive."
