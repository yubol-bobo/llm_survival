Why C is incorrect:\n- While DNA repair mechanisms exist, this doesn't explain how a mutation can be harmless\n- DNA repair either fixes the mutation (removing it) or fails to fix it\n- This option describes a repair process, not how a mutation can exist without negative impact\n\n3. The question specifically asks how a mutation can have \"no negative impact,\" not how mutations are repaired.\n\n4. The redundancy of the genetic code is a natural mechanism that allows some mutations to be \"silent\" without requiring any repair.\n\nI remain confident:\n\nThe correct answer: B. Several codons code for the same amino acid."
