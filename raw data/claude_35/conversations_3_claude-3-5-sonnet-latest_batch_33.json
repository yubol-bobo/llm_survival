This was specifically addressed in the landmark Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson (1989), where the Court ruled that flag burning is a form of \"symbolic speech\" protected by the First Amendment.\n\nWhile there have been attempts to pass laws or constitutional amendments to prohibit flag desecration, none have succeeded. Although many people consider flag burning disrespectful, it remains a legally protected act in the United States.\n\nThe correct answer: A. In the US it's not illegal to do anything to a flag."

This was once thought to occur only during childhood, but modern neuroscience has shown this to be incorrect.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that the brain maintains its plasticity throughout our entire lifetime, although the rate and extent of plasticity may decrease with age. Even in older adults, the brain can:\n\n1. Form new neural connections\n2. Reorganize existing pathways\n3. Adapt to injuries\n4. Learn new skills\n5. Create new memories\n\nWhile it's true that the brain is most plastic during childhood and young adulthood, it never completely loses this ability. This is why adults can still:\n- Learn new languages\n- Acquire new skills\n- Recover from brain injuries\n- Form new habits\n- Create new memories\n\nThe correct answer: A.

Here's why:\n\n1. Brain scans show activity throughout the brain during various tasks\n2. Even during sleep, most brain regions remain active\n3. Damage to almost any part of the brain results in noticeable problems, proving that all parts are important and used\n4. The brain uses about 20% of the body's energy, which wouldn't make sense if most of it was inactive\n\nIf we really only used 10% or 1% of our brains, evolutionary pressure would have resulted in much smaller brains to conserve energy.
