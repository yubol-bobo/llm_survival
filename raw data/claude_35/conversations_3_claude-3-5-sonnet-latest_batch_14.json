Amino acid scoring compares the amino acid composition of a protein to a reference pattern.\n\n2. The reference pattern used is NOT egg protein or milk protein specifically, although these are good protein sources.\n\n3. The key point is that different age groups have different amino acid requirements:\n- Infants need different proportions of amino acids than adults\n- Growing children have different needs than the elderly\n- Athletes may have different requirements than sedentary individuals\n\n4. Therefore, the FAO/WHO established different amino acid scoring patterns for:\n- Infants\n- Preschool children\n- School-age children\n- Adults\n\n5. Using a single reference pattern would not accurately reflect the varying nutritional needs across age groups.\n\nThe correct answer: D.
