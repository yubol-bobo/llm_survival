Hofstede's model is one of the most widely recognized frameworks for understanding cultural differences across nations.\n\nPower distance specifically refers to the extent to which less powerful members of organizations and institutions accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. This concept is just one part of Hofstede's larger framework, which also includes:\n- Individualism vs. Collectivism\n- Masculinity vs. Femininity\n- Uncertainty Avoidance\n- Long-term vs. Short-term Orientation\n- Indulgence vs. Restraint\n\nWhile other scholars like Michael Porter, have made significant contributions to international business theory, the concept of power distance is specifically attributed to Hofstede's work.\n\nThe correct answer: A.
