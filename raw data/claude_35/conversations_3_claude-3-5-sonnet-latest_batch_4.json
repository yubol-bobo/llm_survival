Here's why:\n\nIn Merkle-Damgård hash functions, when performing a length-extension attack:\n1) The hash function internally adds a padding block (PB) after processing each message\n2) When you have H(k∥m), you can continue hashing, but you must account for this padding block\n3) You can't just append w directly to k∥m as suggested in option B\n4) The correct attack is to compute H(k∥m∥PB∥w) as shown in option C\n\nOption B is incorrect because it ignores the padding block that must exist between m and w. The length-extension attack works precisely because you can compute H(k∥m∥PB∥w), not H(k∥m∥w).\n\nThe correct answer: C"
