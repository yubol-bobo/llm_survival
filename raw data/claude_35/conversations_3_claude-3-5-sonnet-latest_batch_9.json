Research and clinical observations about adult exhibitionists have shown that:\n\n1. They often suffer from various psychological and psychiatric problems, including anxiety, depression, and other personality disorders.\n\n2. Studies have found that exhibitionists typically have poor self-esteem and difficulty with interpersonal relationships.\n\n3. Rather than having excellent social skills, they often struggle with normal social interactions and forming healthy relationships.\n\n4. Their sexual relationships are usually problematic, and they rarely have fulfilling sex lives due to their psychological issues and difficulty maintaining intimate relationships.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA. \"Typically psychiatrically disturbed\" - This aligns with clinical findings\nB. \"Unassertive\" - This matches their typical personality profile\nC. \"Have excellent social skills\" - This is incorrect\nD. \"Have fulfilling sex lives\" - This is incorrect\n\nThe correct answer: A. are typically psychiatrically disturbed."
