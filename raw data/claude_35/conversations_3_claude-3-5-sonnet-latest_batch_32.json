These bright red phone boxes were designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and became a quintessential part of British streetscapes.\n\nWhile they can be found in various parts of the UK, tourists specifically seeking out these iconic red telephone boxes would most commonly look in England, as they are most numerous and well-preserved there.
