Rawls' theory involves people making decisions from behind a \"veil of ignorance\" (the original position), where they don't know their place in society.\n\n2. Key points about Rawls' views:\n- He believed liberty was fundamental and should be prioritized\n- He supported the 'maximin' strategy (maximizing the minimum)\n- He advocated for the difference principle (inequalities are only justified if they benefit the least advantaged)\n- He rejected the system of natural liberty as unfair\n\n3. Among these options, Rawls strongly argued that people in the original position would:\n- Always prioritize liberty over equality\n- Choose maximin strategy\n- Support the difference principle\n- Reject pure natural liberty\n\n4. The option stating \"POP would choose equality above liberty\" directly contradicts Rawls' first principle of justice, which gives priority to liberty.\n\nThe correct answer: A. The POP would choose equality above liberty."

As two defendants were walking down the street, they noticed a victim park his metallic gold sports car and enter the pool hail. When they approached the car, one of the defendants observed that the victim had left the keys in the ignition. Knowing that the victim would be hustling pool all evening, the defendants hopped into the sports car and drove off, intending to return the car later that evening., C. During a craps game in the back room of a bar, the defendant lost $150 to the victim. The defendant left the bar after losing his money and returned an hour later with a gun in his possession. Honestly believing that the $150 still belonged to him, the defendant confronted the victim in the back room and demanded the return of his money.

Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action? A. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster., B. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach., C. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy., D. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription."

No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy."

Will the Court likely grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the indisputable fact that the consumer did not read the warning, which the defendant argued renders the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law? A. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case., B. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous., C.

Important legal principles:\n- Contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability\n- Product misuse can be a defense to strict liability\n- Assumption of risk can be a defense to strict liability\n- Failure to read a warning alone doesn't automatically bar recovery\n\n4. Analysis:\n- The mere fact that the consumer didn't read the warning doesn't automatically invalidate the lawsuit\n- The consumer's negligence in not reading the warning is irrelevant in strict liability\n- The case should proceed to determine if there was actually a manufacturing defect\n- Summary judgment would be inappropriate as there are factual issues to resolve\n\nThe correct answer: A. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case."
