This diffraction enables sound waves to bend around obstacles and reach our ears from around a corner.\n\nOn the other hand, light waves have an extremely short wavelength, on the order of hundreds of nanometers.

Because the confidence interval size is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size, tripling the sample size will change the interval size by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## 3: Calculate the factor by which the interval size changes\nThe factor by which the interval size changes is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ because the interval size decreases as the sample size increases. To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$, getting $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

But we do not have the right to resort to violence—or the threat of violence—when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom. Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time. But we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton, \"What We Learned in Oklahoma City,\" 2010\n(Written on the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing)\n\"If there would not have been a Waco, I would have put down roots somewhere and not been so unsettled with the fact that my government…was a threat to me. Everything that Waco implies was on the forefront of my thoughts. That sort of guided my path for the next couple of years.\"\nTimothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City bomber, 2001\nU.S. Representative John Conyers, Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas: Hearing Before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 1993\nThe above excerpts most closely support which of the following inferences? A. In the 1990s, anti-government sentiment, in response to excessive uses of federal power to resolve domestic conflicts, inspired militia groups and lone vigilantes, such as Timothy McVeigh., B. In 1993 Attorney General Janet Reno launched an offensive against the Branch Davidian cult led by Timothy McVeigh, later drawing criticism from Congress for her heavy-handed approach., C. Fearing a rise in anti-government sentiment after the Oklahoma City bombing, Attorney General Janet Reno sent troops to quell the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff, and later faced congressional criticism., D. Attorney General Janet Reno resigned from office in part due to Congressional pressure put on President Clinton by Representative John Conyers."

He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n—Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nWhich of the following statements best describes Eric Foner's argument about President Abraham Lincoln's views on slavery? A. President Lincoln was a consistent supporter of the abolitionist cause., B. President Lincoln was reluctant to be ideologically associated with advocates like Frederick Douglass., C. In his ambition to become president, Abraham Lincoln declared his desire to use his constitutional powers to end slavery., D. President Lincoln had continually changing views on slavery and abolition that did not always fit into the prevailing political categories."

He also never claimed to be an abolitionist or a Radical Republican, and while his views on race changed during the Civil War, he didn't become a principled egalitarian like some abolitionists and Radical Republicans. This suggests that Lincoln was reluctant to be ideologically associated with advocates like Frederick Douglass, who was an abolitionist. \n\nHowever, a more fitting answer would be: \nThe correct answer: D.\n\nThis answer captures Foner's argument more accurately. Foner states that Lincoln \"never became a principled egalitarian\" and made a distinction between his personal views and official duties. This indicates that Lincoln's views on slavery and abolition did not fit neatly into prevailing categories, such as abolitionist or Radical Republican."

This concept is more similar to Containment policy toward the Soviet Union (D), which was a strategy to prevent the spread of communism and maintain stability during the Cold War.\n\nBoth concepts aim to prevent aggression and maintain stability, but in different contexts. Containment policy focused on limiting Soviet expansion, while the \"new world order\" focuses on collective action against aggression in a post-Cold War world.\n\nThe other options are less relevant:\n* The Monroe Doctrine (A) focuses on U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere.\n* Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" (B) emphasizes American power and diplomacy backed by military might.\n* Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points (C) was a more idealistic and comprehensive plan for a new international order, but Containment policy toward the Soviet Union (D) is a more direct comparison in terms of strategic goals."

Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nRodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?
