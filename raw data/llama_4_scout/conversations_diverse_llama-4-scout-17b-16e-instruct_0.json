This allows more light to enter the eye and enhances the ability to see during low-light conditions.\n\n- C: Increase in intestinal secretion and motility is generally associated with parasympathetic stimulation. Sympathetic stimulation tends to decrease intestinal secretion and motility, redirecting blood flow to skeletal muscles.\n\n- D: Decrease in heart rate is caused by activation of the parasympathetic nervous system (vagal stimulation), not by sympathetic nerves.

This binding causes tropomyosin to shift, exposing myosin binding sites on actin.\n\n## 3: Evaluating Statements\n- A, B, and C are accurate descriptions of aspects of muscle contraction.\n- D suggests calcium binds directly to tropomyosin, which is incorrect.

When it comes to finding memory errors, certain tools and techniques can be particularly helpful.\n\n- A: Grammar-based fuzzers can actually be effective at finding memory errors. They generate inputs that follow a given grammar, which can be useful for targeting specific areas of a program, such as a parser. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\n- B: Compiling a program with Address Sanitizer (ASAN) is designed to help detect memory errors. ASAN does not make errors harder to reproduce; rather, it helps in identifying and reporting memory issues. So, statement B is incorrect.\n\n- C: Compiling a program with ASAN provides additional checks during execution that can identify memory errors such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and others. When a memory error occurs, ASAN reports detailed information about the error, which makes the source of a memory error easier to find. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\n- D: Fuzzing can indeed find crashes and hangs, but it is also commonly used to find memory errors.

If \\(S(k, m)\\) is always 5 bits long, this implies that the tag space is very small (only \\(2^5 = 32\\) possible tags). \n\nFor a MAC to be secure, it should be existentially unforgeable under chosen-message attacks, meaning that even if an attacker can choose messages to be authenticated and get their tags, they still should not be able to produce a valid tag for a new message that was not previously authenticated.\n\nA small tag space (like 5 bits) does not inherently make a MAC insecure, but it does impose limitations. Specifically, if the message space is much larger than the tag space, and an attacker can obtain tags for a set of messages, the possibility of guessing or deducing a valid tag for another message (that hasn't been tagged) increases. However, the actual security also heavily depends on the distribution of tags, the unpredictability of the tags generated by the MAC for any given key, and the computational effort required to forge a tag.\n\nTherefore"
