Taste buds on the posterior third of the tongue: The glossopharyngeal nerve (ninth cranial nerve) is responsible for taste sensation from the posterior third of the tongue, not the facial nerve.\n- B. Muscles of the soft palate: The vagus nerve (tenth cranial nerve) primarily supplies the muscles of the soft palate, although the facial nerve does supply some muscles related to the palate indirectly (e.g., through the lesser petrosal nerve for the parotid gland but directly for the stapedius and stylohyoid muscles).\n- C.

Therefore, even though the chorda tympani is not related to proprioception, the presence of deep temporal nerves in the statement makes C a potentially viable option.

These gaps occur due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter, which causes asteroids at certain orbital distances to be ejected or collide with other objects.\n\n## Step ## Step 2: Recall the cause of Kirkwood gaps.\nThe Kirkwood gaps are primarily caused by orbital resonances with Jupiter. An orbital resonance occurs when the orbital period of an asteroid is a simple fraction of Jupiter's orbital period, leading to a regular gravitational tug from Jupiter that can destabilize the asteroid's orbit.\n\n## Step ## Step 3: Identify the specific orbital resonance related to Kirkwood gaps.\nThe most significant Kirkwood gaps are associated with orbital periods that are simple fractions (like 1/2, 1/3, 2/3) of Jupiter's orbital period. Specifically, a gap occurs where asteroids would have a period half that of Jupiter, corresponding to a 1:2 orbital resonance.\n\n## Step ## Step 4: Examine the given options in relation to Kirkwood gaps.\n- Option A: Asteroids would orbit with a period half that of Jupiter. This corresponds to a 2:1 resonance, a known Kirkwood gap"

Jupiter's orbital period is about 11.86 years. Half of this period is approximately 5.93 years. According to Kepler's third law, the orbital period (P) is related to the semi-major axis (a) by P^2 ∝ a^3. Thus, an asteroid with half Jupiter's period would have a semi-major axis less than Jupiter's, specifically, it would be at a 2:1 resonance, which is a known Kirkwood gap.\n\n## Step ## Step3: Analyze option B\nOption B refers to asteroids with a period twice that of Jupiter, which implies a period of about 23.72 years. This corresponds to an orbital resonance outside Jupiter's orbit, not within the asteroid belt, and is related to a 1:2 resonance with Jupiter.\n\n## Step ## Step4: Analyze option C\nOption C mentions asteroids with a period twice that of Mars. Mars' orbital period is about 1.88 years, so twice this is approximately 3"

While it's true that thymine dimers themselves are not directly \"repaired\" by being removed as is, but rather the nucleotides containing them are, the actual lesion (thymine dimer) is indeed the initial damage. A more accurate interpretation is that the cells in XP accumulate mutations or other secondary lesions due to the inability to properly repair UV-induced damage. However, the most direct consequence of UV exposure is the formation of thymine dimers. Some sources might argue that the actual accrual is of mutations or other downstream effects, but directly, thymine dimers are the initial damage.

Therefore, individuals with XP are more likely to have thymine dimers persisting in their DNA because their cells cannot efficiently repair this type of damage.\n\nWhile it's true that unrepaired thymine dimers can lead to mutations and other downstream effects, the question specifically asks about the molecular lesion most likely to accrue. Thymine dimers are the direct result of UV exposure and are not repaired in XP.\n\nOther options, like deamination of cytosine, depurination, and single-strand DNA breaks, are types of DNA damage that are not directly related to UV exposure or are repaired by different mechanisms.

However, some parts of the pelagic zone also match this description.\n\nTo be more precise, both B. neritic zone and parts of C. pelagic zone can be characterized by penetrance of solar radiation and upwelling of nutrients.

This means that all the sp^3 hybrid orbitals have the same energy, which is true because they are formed by mixing one s and three p orbitals, resulting in four equivalent orbitals.\n- Option B: The set of orbitals has a tetrahedral geometry.

Minimizing their influence is crucial for obtaining reliable results.\n\n## Step ## Step 2: Examine the effect of signal averaging on random errors\nSignal averaging involves taking multiple measurements of a signal and averaging them to obtain a more accurate representation of the signal.

However, they do not directly minimize random errors.\n\n## Step ## Step 4: Evaluate the impact of averaging results from multiple samples on random errors\nAveraging the results from multiple samples can help reduce the effect of random errors because the random fluctuations in the measurements from different samples tend to cancel each other out when averaged.\n\n## Step ## Step 5: Determine which procedures minimize the influence of random"

In liquid ammonia, the solvent itself can act as an acid or a base.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the acid-base behavior in liquid ammonia\nIn liquid ammonia, NH3 (ammonia) can accept a proton (H+) to form NH4+ (ammonium ion), acting as a base. Conversely, it can also donate a proton, but more relevantly, it can accept a proton to form NH4+, and the conjugate base of NH3 is NH2− (amide ion).\n\n## Step 3: Recognize the strongest base in liquid ammonia\nThe strongest base in a given solvent is the conjugate base of the solvent. Since NH3 is the solvent, its conjugate base, NH2−, is the strongest base in liquid ammonia because it is the base that results from the autoprotolysis or the acceptance of a proton by NH3, forming NH4+ and NH2−.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the options\nA.
