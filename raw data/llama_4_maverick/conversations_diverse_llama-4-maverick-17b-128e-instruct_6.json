The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nThe instructions indicated in the fourth paragraph to remain nonviolent most likely inspired which of the following historical developments?

However, the question asks about the changes that occurred under the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty marked a significant shift in Chinese trade policies.

One of the notable changes was the restriction of foreign merchants to specific areas, which aligns with option A.

Option C is incorrect because, although the Ming Dynasty did engage in maritime expeditions under Admiral Zheng He, the government generally did not endorse or actively support Chinese merchants conducting trade missions abroad after these expeditions ceased.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

For DVD players, the selling price is $200 and the variable cost is $160, so the contribution margin per unit is $200 - $160 = $40. For home entertainment systems, the selling price is $600 and the variable cost is $460, so the contribution margin per unit is $600 - $460 = $140.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the weighted contribution margin based on the sales mix.\nThe company sells one home entertainment system for every four DVD players. This means the sales mix is 4:1 (DVD players:home entertainment systems). To find the weighted contribution margin, we calculate: (4 * $40 + 1 * $140) / (4 + 1) = ($160 + $140) / 5 = $300 / 5 = $60 per unit of the mix.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of units in the sales mix that need to be sold to break even.\nThe company's fixed costs are $90,000.

Nonetheless, the most accurate response, taking into account the nuances of international law, is that a reservation is invalid under the conditions described in both C and D, but the options do not allow for a combined selection.

Options A, B, and D do not accurately describe the current law and practice regarding 'equitable result' in maritime delimitation.

One afternoon, the woman was in the kitchen of her home preparing a snack when she glanced out the window and saw a horrible crime being committed. The woman watched in horror as a local gang member pulled out a handgun and used it to shoot the victim, a member of a rival gang. The gang member did not know anyone was witnessing his act of shooting the victim. The woman watched as the victim collapsed and fell dead on her neighbor's front lawn. As a result of her shock from viewing this horrible incident, the woman suffered a miscarriage. If the woman asserts a claim against the local gang member who shot the victim, the woman will A. recover, because she suffered a physical injury, rather than just emotional harm., B. recover, because the gang member acted intentionally in shooting the victim., C. not recover, because the woman was not within the zone of danger., D. not recover, because the gang member was unaware that the woman was watching."

To succeed in a negligence claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that they suffered actual harm or injury as a result of the defendant's breach of duty. In this scenario, despite being shocked and momentarily stunned, the resident did not sustain any actual injury.

Negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages. While the telephone company's technician breached their duty, and this breach caused the electric shock, the resident did not suffer actual damages. Nominal damages are not typically awarded in negligence cases, and the resident's claim relies on proving actual harm. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the resident will not recover."

The telephone company's technician was negligent, and the doctrine of respondeat superior holds the telephone company liable for the technician's actions. This doctrine is applicable because the technician was acting within the scope of their employment when they incorrectly rewired the telephone.

The witness's unavailability is a crucial factor in determining the admissibility of prior testimony. The Supreme Court has established that prior testimony can be admissible if the witness is unavailable (Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56). In this case, the friend's refusal to testify rendered him unavailable. However, the Court has also emphasized that the prosecution must make a good-faith effort to produce the witness (Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719). The fact that the friend was cited for contempt suggests that the prosecution made an effort to secure his testimony. Nevertheless, the correct answer is B, as it is the most directly relevant to the issue at hand. The student's appeal will most likely be granted because the witness's unavailability was not properly established as a justification for admitting the prior testimony under the Confrontation Clause, but more directly, the Roberts test includes both unavailability and reliability. However, the issue is more related to the fact that the opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing may not be sufficient to satisfy the Confrontation Clause, which is more directly addressed by answer A.\n\nHowever, the best answer"
