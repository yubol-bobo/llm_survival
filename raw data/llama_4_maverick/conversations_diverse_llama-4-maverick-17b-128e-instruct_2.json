However, reevaluating: if there are4 loops, it means there are4 antinodes, and the formula is L = nλ/2. So,12 =4λ/2, which simplifies to12 =2λ. Hence, λ =6.00 m. But actually, the correct step is: 2λ =12, so λ =6. To get the correct answer, we should directly check the options. For D, λ =3, then2λ =6, and4λ/2 =6. No, that's not it. Let's directly apply: 4λ/2 =12, so2λ =12, λ =6. For D: if λ =3, then4λ/2 =6, not12. The actual calculation directly gives λ =6. \n\nThe correct answer: C."

In mechanical systems, both mass and spring elements store energy. Mass elements store kinetic energy, and spring elements store potential energy.\n\n## Step ## Step 4: Calculate the order of the transfer function\nThe total number of energy-storing elements is the sum of mass and spring elements, which is 2 (mass) + 2 (spring) = 4. The order of the transfer function is determined by the number of independent energy-storing elements. Friction elements (damping) do not store energy but affect the system's behavior by dissipating energy.\n\n## Step"

In mechanical systems, these are mass elements and spring elements.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the rule to the given system\nThere are 2 mass elements and 2 spring elements.

The order of the system is equal to the number of energy-storing elements because each energy-storing element contributes to the system's dynamics, typically resulting in a second-order differential equation for each independent element.

For a pixel at position (x, y), the new value would be $1*I(x-1, y-1) + 1*I(x, y) + 1*I(x+1, y+1)$, where $I(x, y)$ denotes the intensity of the pixel at (x, y). This effectively samples pixels diagonally and sums them, which generally changes the image.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze option B - Convolving an image"
