The amount of diffraction that occurs depends on the wavelength of the wave relative to the size of the obstacle or corner. Sound waves have wavelengths that are typically on the order of meters (e.g., a 1000 Hz sound wave has a wavelength of about 0.34 meters), which is comparable to the size of everyday objects and corners. As a result, sound waves can diffract around corners, allowing us to hear sounds from around a corner. On the other hand, light has a very short wavelength (on the order of hundreds of nanometers), which is much smaller than the size of everyday objects and corners. Consequently, light does not diffract significantly around corners, making it generally not visible from around a corner. Therefore, the correct explanation is that sound has a longer wavelength, which increases its diffraction, making option B the correct answer."

After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We … discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.… At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n—Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nSettlement houses like Hull House expressed a desire of reformers to do which of the following?

The time period mentioned (1450-1750 C.E.) corresponds to the transatlantic slave trade, which led to the expansion of the African diaspora to the New World. Rodney's argument is likely a response to this historical phenomenon, as the slave trade drained Africa of its human resources and contributed to its economic underdevelopment. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer. Additionally, during 1450-1750 C.E., European colonization of the interior of Africa had not yet occurred, making option A incorrect.

However, it does mention that \"When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him.\" This action is similar to the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow, which involves kneeling and bowing to show respect. Although the passage doesn't explicitly state that the Ghanian king adopted the kow-tow, the similarity in the greeting is a plausible indication of cultural exchange or influence. Therefore, the best available answer is B. The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow."

One of the key issues at stake was the question of salvation. Luther and other Protestants argued that salvation came through faith alone, while the Catholic Church maintained that good works and sacraments were also necessary. At Trent, the Church reaffirmed its position, rejecting the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone. Therefore, the correct answer is D. It rejected salvation based on faith alone."
