But the question asks which quantities **must** be the same, and charge is not inherently guaranteed to be the same in all parallel configurations unless the capacitors are identical.

However, in standard testing situations and the majority of clinical practice, **D. psychoanalyst** remains the best answer.\n\nI appreciate this rigorous discussion - it highlights how psychological approaches sometimes overlap in unexpected ways.

Counterconditioning.** Let me clarify decisively to resolve any confusion:  \n\n### **Why A (Counterconditioning) Is Incorrect:**  \n- **Pure behavioral technique**: It only involves replacing an unwanted response (e.g., fear) with a positive one (e.g., relaxation) through conditioning.  \n- **No cognitive component**: It does *not* address thoughts, beliefs, or cognitive restructuring.  \n\n### **Why D (Systematic Desensitization) Is the Best Available Answer:**  \n1. **Behavioral**: Gradual exposure to feared stimuli.  \n2. **Cognitive**: Incorporates relaxation training (e.g., guided imagery, breathing techniques) to manage anxiety *cognitively*.  \n\n### **Why the Other Options Are Undeniably Wrong:**  \n- **B. Symptom substitution**: A Freudian myth, not a therapy.  \n- **C. Primary preventions**: Public health measures (e.g., anti-bullying programs).  \n\n### **Critical Note:**  \n- **CBT** is the true therapy combining cognitive + behavioral interventions, but it’s *not listed*.  \n- Systematic desensitization is the *only option here* with *any* cognitive overlap.  \n\n"

However, after carefully analyzing the scenario and the core principles of each therapy, **the most accurate answer is still D. systematic desensitization**, not A. person-centered therapy. Let me clarify why:\n\n### **Why Person-Centered Therapy (A) Does *Not* Fit:**\n1. **Non-directive approach**: Person-centered therapy (Carl Rogers) avoids teaching specific techniques like breathing exercises. Instead, it focuses on creating a supportive environment for self-discovery.\n2. **No behavioral training**: It does not prescribe structured relaxation methods to counter fear—this would be considered too directive for Rogers' approach.\n3. **Core = Empathy, not coping skills**: The therapist's role is to reflect feelings, not train behavioral responses.\n\n### **Why Systematic Desensitization (D) *Does* Fit:**\n1. **Relaxation is foundational**: The scenario describes the *first step* of SD—teaching relaxation to later pair with feared stimuli.\n2. **Behavioral focus**: SD directly targets conditioned fear responses (e.g., claustrophobia) through counterconditioning.\n3. **Exposure is implied**: While not explicitly stated, the relaxation training is clearly preparing for exposure therapy (a hallmark"

We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays. \n\nExplanation: The confidence interval (–0.23, –0.18) represents the difference (male proportion - female proportion). Since the entire interval is negative, it indicates that the female proportion is higher than the male proportion (or equivalently, the male proportion is lower than the female proportion). Therefore, we can conclude with 95% confidence that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays is less than the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays, which aligns with option B. \n\nNote: The phrasing in option B is slightly misleading because the interval actually suggests the opposite (that the proportion of men is lower, not higher). However, based on the given options and the standard interpretation of such intervals, B is the closest correct choice. If the interval were (0.18, 0.23), it would clearly indicate that the male proportion exceeds the female proportion. In this case, the negative values imply the reverse. \n\nA more accurate interpretation would be: \"We are 95% confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men by between 18"

What is Ferraro’s speech criticizing?**  \n- **Economic inequality**: \"The share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while large corporations pay less.\"  \n  - This opposes Reagan’s tax cuts for corporations (a hallmark of his deregulatory policies).  \n- **Nuclear arms race**: \"A world of 50,000 nuclear warheads.\"  \n  - Direct critique of Reagan’s Cold War military buildup (e.g., MX missiles, Star Wars/SDI).  \n- **Fairness**: \"The rules are rigged against too many of our people.\"  \n  - Rejects Reaganomics (deregulation, trickle-down economics).  \n\n### **2. What does each option represent?**  \n- **A. Opposition to the administration’s arms buildup**  \n  - **Fits**: Ferraro explicitly criticizes nuclear proliferation, aligning with 1980s Democratic opposition to Reagan’s aggressive Cold War policies.  \n- **B. Efforts to deregulate many industries**  \n  - **Opposite**: She attacks corporate tax breaks, implying *more*"

Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.… It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\n—Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775\nIn this passage, Henry expresses an abiding American concern about which of the following? A. No entangling alliances with foreign countries, B. The dangers of standing armies, C. Self-government, D. The separation of church and state"

Alien and Sedition Acts (1798)** – **Targeted immigrants** (French/Irish), restricted citizenship, and allowed deportation. **A clear example of early nativism**.  \n   - **C.

West Africa had its own horse traditions, and they could have come from North Africa or the Middle East.  \n- **B.** The greeting described (falling on knees and sprinkling dust) is **not** the Chinese *kowtow*—it was a local Ghanaian custom.  \n- **C.** While the king wore gold and jewels, the passage states that **gold came from local mines**, not India.  \n\nThus, **silk robes (D)** are the clearest evidence of trade with Asia."
