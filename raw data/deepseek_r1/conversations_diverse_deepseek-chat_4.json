It does this through (1) expressing our ideas in clear, concise language and (2) supporting those ideas with reasons and with overcoming objections to them.  Philosophy thus emphasizes the need to: A. pose questions that can be resolved not by reasoning but only by faith or personal belief., B. show why the beliefs adopted by most people in a culture are preferable since more people understand those beliefs and see no reason to raise objections to them., C. articulate what we mean by our beliefs and to justify our beliefs by arguments., D. develop a set of ideas about the nature of society (i.e., an ideology) that can be used to support a religious conceptual framework."

Logic**: Cicero calls it *\"a sharp weapon for philosophers, but useless unless wielded by moral wisdom\"* (*De Oratore* 1.48).  \n2. **B. Natural science**: He admires it but declares it *\"irrelevant to daily conduct\"* (*Tusculan Disputations* 1.18).  \n3. **D.

An unexamined life lacks this reflection, meaning a person acts out of habit, convention, or ignorance rather than true understanding.  \n\n- **Why not A?** Socrates wouldn’t accept that virtue is merely about being *perceived* as good by others (who may also be ignorant). True virtue requires *actual* knowledge, not just social approval.  \n- **Why not B?** While Socrates did value philosophy, this answer reduces his claim to mere bias rather than his core argument about knowledge and virtue.  \n- **Why not D?** Socrates often *challenged* societal norms (e.g., in his trial) rather than blindly following them. Virtue requires independent examination, not conformity.  \n\n**Key Socratic Principle:** If you don’t *understand* why an action is good, you can’t consistently act virtuously.

The Pauli exclusion principle. \n\nThe difference in energy between ortho- (parallel spins) and para- (antiparallel spins) states in helium arises due to the symmetry requirements of the total wavefunction under electron exchange. The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that the total wavefunction (spatial × spin) must be antisymmetric for fermions like electrons. \n\n- In the para-state (antiparallel spins), the spin part is antisymmetric (singlet state), so the spatial part must be symmetric, allowing the electrons to be closer together. This increases Coulomb repulsion, raising the energy.  \n- In the ortho-state (parallel spins), the spin part is symmetric (triplet state), so the spatial part must be antisymmetric, keeping the electrons farther apart on average. This reduces Coulomb repulsion, lowering the energy. \n\nThus, the ortho-state has lower energy due to the Pauli exclusion principle influencing electron spatial distributions."
