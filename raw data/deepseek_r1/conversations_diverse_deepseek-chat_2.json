Let me explain why with absolute clarity:\n\n### Why D (\"All of these\") is incorrect:\n1. **Radiant energy (A)** is heat transfer via electromagnetic waves (radiation) - this is fundamentally different from convection\n2. **Insulators (C)** by definition resist heat transfer - they don't participate in convection\n3. **Convection specifically requires fluid movement** - this is its defining characteristic\n\n### Why this confusion happens:\n- In nature, heat transfer often involves multiple processes working together (like in Earth's atmosphere where radiation, conduction and convection all occur)\n- But when we isolate just \"thermal convection,\" we're talking specifically about fluid movement\n\n### Scientific consensus:\nEvery physics textbook defines convection as heat transfer through fluid motion. For example:\n- \"Convection is the heat transfer due to bulk movement of molecules within fluids\" (University Physics, Young & Freedman)\n- \"Convection requires a fluid medium\" (Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, Incropera)\n\nWould you like me to provide any specific textbook references or examples to further clarify?

The standard definition holds that \"P only if Q\" translates to P ⊃ Q\n2. The biconditional (≡) would require additional wording like \"if and only if\"\n3.

Swinging often prioritizes variety (\"soft swap,\" \"full swap,\" group play) rather than repeated partnerships, though some couples do form ongoing connections.  \n- **Option C** is *false*. While threesomes (MFM or FMF) occur, the \"typical introduction\" varies widely—many start with couple swaps or lifestyle events, not a specific gender configuration.  \n- **Option D** is *accurate*. Swingers generally exhibit openness to diverse sexual practices (e.g., BDSM, role-play, etc.), though preferences vary by individual/couple.  \n\n**Key Insight:** Swinging norms are highly context-dependent, but broad-mindedness toward unconventional sexuality (Option D) is a well-documented trend in research (e.g., Bergstrand & Williams, "
