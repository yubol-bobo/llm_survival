This was the **fur-trade model**: Natives trapped furs; the HBC supplied tools/weapons in return.  \n   - If Simpson wanted tobacco or silver, he’d have worked for a different company (e.g., Virginia tobacco planters or Spanish mines).  \n\n3. **Primary Source Evidence**:  \n   - HBC archives show **99% of traded goods** were furs. Simpson’s letters obsess over beaver pelts, not other commodities.  \n\n"

This is well-documented in historical records.\n\n2. **Tobacco in Context**: While tobacco was indeed a trade item in colonial North America, it flowed in the opposite direction - European traders typically provided tobacco to Indigenous peoples as a trade good, not the other way around. Indigenous groups in the regions where HBC operated (northern North America) were not significant producers of tobacco for trade.\n\n3. **George Simpson's Role**: As head of the HBC's Northern Department, Simpson's explicit focus was on maximizing fur returns. His correspondence and company records consistently emphasize furs as the sole commodity of importance in their trade networks.\n\n4. **Economic Control Mechanism**: The passage describes creating dependence through trade - this perfectly matches the HBC's practice of supplying tools/weapons on credit to be repaid in furs, creating a cycle of debt and dependence that secured their fur supply.\n\nWhile tobacco was traded elsewhere in"

Its silver came primarily from:\n     - **The Middle East** (Ottoman/Persian trade routes).\n     - Some re-exported New World silver that reached India via Europe, but this was minimal compared to Middle Eastern flows.\n\n2. **Historical Reality**:\n   - In the late 16th century, the **Ottoman Empire and Persia** were the dominant suppliers of silver to India (and thus to China via Portuguese traders).\n   - While the New World (D) produced vast amounts of silver, most flowed to China **via Manila (not India)** or through Europe later in the 17th century.\n\n3. **Why Not Other Options?**:\n   - **New World (D)**: While important globally,"

The Chinese government restricted foreign merchants to specific sites in the coastal cities.**  \n\n### Explanation:  \nThe passage describes foreign communities (Muslims, Jews, Christians) living in designated areas of Hangzhou during the **Yuan Dynasty** (when Ibn Battuta visited). However, the question asks about changes under the **Ming Dynasty (1368–1644)**, which followed the Yuan.  \n\n- **Option A** is correct because the Ming Dynasty imposed stricter controls on foreign trade, confining merchants to specific ports (like Canton/Guangzhou) and limiting their movement.  \n- **Option B** (monopolies on salt/iron) was a long-standing policy in China (since the Han Dynasty), not a Ming-specific change.  \n- **Option C** is incorrect—the Ming famously **restricted** private overseas trade (e.g., the Haijin policy) and only later sponsored Zheng He's state-led voyages.  \n- **Option D** is false—the Ming upheld Confucian ideals, which generally looked down on merchants.  \n\nThus, the key Ming shift was **greater restrictions on foreign traders**, making **A** the best answer."

These factors strongly suggest that the marital strain stems from the difficulties of maintaining a relationship across great distances—a common issue for merchant families in long-distance trade networks.  \n\n### Why not the other options?  \n- **B.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history? A. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other, B. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era, C. Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E., D. How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion"

What a Judge *Ad Hoc* Actually Is (Article 31, ICJ Statute)**  \nThe ICJ’s founding document states:  \n> *\"If the Court includes upon the Bench **no judge of the nationality of the parties**, each of these parties may proceed to **choose a judge [ad hoc] for the purpose of the particular case**.\"*  \n\\- [ICJ Statute, Article 31](https://www.icj-cij.org/statute)  \n\n- **Key**: A judge *ad hoc* is **only appointed when a party lacks a judge of its nationality** on the ICJ bench.  \n- They are **not substitutes** for disqualified/deceased judges (that’s a different process under ICJ rules).  \n\n#### **2.

Why Option A is Correct (Beyond Any Reasonable Doubt)**\n- **Legal Text:** Article 53 of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969)* defines *jus cogens* explicitly as norms **from which no derogation is permitted**, even by state consent. This matches Option A verbatim in substance.  \n- **ICJ & Legal Scholarship:** The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and authoritative sources (e.g., ILC Draft Conclusions) consistently affirm this definition.  \n- **Examples:** Prohibitions on genocide, slavery, torture, and wars of aggression are universally recognized as *jus cogens*—no state can legally \"opt out\" of these.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Why Other Options Are Incorrect**\n- **Option B** (Multilateral treaties): Treaties, even widely ratified ones (e.g., UN Charter), can be modified or withdrawn from. *Jus cogens*"

Asserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties -only when they are actually imposed.  \n\nThis option formulates the interest theory without relying on the strict correlativity of rights and duties (a key feature of the will theory). Instead, it focuses on the protection of X's interest as a justification for imposing duties on others, even if those duties are not yet in place. This aligns with the interest theory's emphasis on rights serving to advance or protect interests, rather than being strictly tied to the enforcement of correlative duties through the exercise of will."

A resident, who lived two doors away, walked to the hardware store to use the telephone. He wanted to call his son and daughter- in-law to wish them a happy Thanksgiving, but his home phone was out of order. The resident picked up the receiver, inserted coins for the cost of the call, and promptly received an electric shock. Although the resident was momentarily stunned, he did not suffer any pain or injuries.

Thereafter, the student was convicted of violating the aforementioned hazing statute. The student appeals the conviction and contends that the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. As to this claim, the student's appeal will most likely be A. granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial., B. granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable., C. denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for crossexamination at the preliminary hearing., D. denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule."
