Earth/Mars/Venus formed from similar stuff.  \n2. **Gaseous material isn’t relevant here**: The asteroid belt was never far enough from the Sun to capture gas like Jupiter did.  \n3. **The real issue was dynamics, not composition**: Even with 100% rocks, a planet *could* have formed—but Jupiter’s gravity (D) stopped it.  \n\n### **Why D Still Wins**  \n- **Jupiter’s resonances** explain:  \n  - Why rocks didn’t merge (high-speed collisions = shattering, not sticking).  \n  - Why 99% of the belt’s mass was ejected.  \n- **C** misattributes the cause to composition, when it was really gravity.  \n\n### **Analogy**:  \nImagine trying to build a sandcastle (planet) in a tidal zone (Jupiter’s gravity)."

The logistic growth model shows:\n\n1. **Exponential growth phase (midpoint)**: Population grows fastest here (steepest slope)\n2. **Carrying capacity (K)**: Population stabilizes\n\n### **Evaluating Each Option:**\n\n**A. Maintain at midpoint**  \n- This is the *worst* strategy because it keeps the population in its fastest growth phase  \n- Actively counterproductive for control  \n\n**B. Zero control at K**  \n- Allows population to reach maximum sustainable size  \n- No reduction in numbers  \n\n**C. Reduce carrying capacity (K)**  \n- *Most effective long-term strategy*  \n- Changes the fundamental limit of population size  \n- Example: Eliminating standing water reduces breeding sites  \n\n**D. Increase mortality rate**  \n- Provides immediate reduction  \n- Doesn't change K (population can rebound)  \n- Requires constant intervention  \n\n### **Why C is Correct:**\n\n1. **Population dynamics perspective**: Only reducing K provides lasting control by changing the system's"

Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.**\n\nKey points:\n1. For octahedral complexes with monodentate achiral ligands, optical isomerism requires:\n   - At least three different ligand types (e.g., [Ma3b2c] or [Ma2b2c2] configurations)\n   - Specific geometric arrangements that lack mirror symmetry\n\n2. Why the other options are incorrect:\n   - A: Square planar complexes cannot show optical isomerism under any circumstances\n   - B: While rare, tetrahedral complexes with four different achiral ligands can theoretically show optical isomerism\n   - C: Linear complexes can never show optical isomerism\n\n3. Critical clarification:\n   - The question specifies \"complexes containing achiral ligands,\" meaning we exclude cases where ligands themselves are chiral\n   - For octahedral monodentate complexes, the minimum requirement is indeed three different ligand types to potentially create"
