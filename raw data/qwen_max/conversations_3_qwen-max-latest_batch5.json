A single reference pattern is used to calculate the amino acid score for all ages.**\n\n### Explanation:\nI understand your reasoning, but the correct answer is **not A**. Here’s why:\n\nThe **amino acid score (AAS)** is calculated by comparing the amino acid profile of a protein to a **standardized reference pattern** based on human amino acid requirements, not directly to the amino acid pattern of egg protein or any other specific food protein. While egg protein is often considered a \"gold standard\" for protein quality due to its excellent amino acid profile, the AAS method does not use"

Upon reevaluating the question carefully:\n\nThe **amino acid score (AAS)** was historically determined by comparing the amino acid profile of a given protein to a **reference protein**, which was often based on **egg protein** or **milk protein** because these proteins have amino acid profiles that closely match human requirements. \n\nWhile modern methods now use a **standardized reference pattern** derived from human amino"
