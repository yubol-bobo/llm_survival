The rank of the matrix, which is the number of linearly independent rows, is 1. According to the rank-nullity theorem, the dimensionality of the null space (nullity) is given by the formula: nullity = number of columns - rank. Therefore, nullity = 3 - 1 = 2. So, the dimensionality of the null space is 2."
