Let me explain the difference between **shaping** and **chaining** to clarify:\n\n### Why It’s Not Chaining:\n- **Chaining** is a technique used to teach complex behaviors that consist of a sequence of smaller, discrete steps. Each step in the chain must be performed in a specific order to complete the task. For example, chaining might be used to teach a student how to play an entire piece by breaking it into small sections and linking them together.\n"

An outlier is defined as a data point that differs significantly from other observations. It does not have to be smaller, larger, or less frequent—it just stands out as unusual compared to the rest of the data. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they either mischaracterize the nature of outliers or impose conditions that are not true for all outliers."

The Counterculture Movement of the 1960s was deeply concerned with opposing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, as highlighted in the excerpt from John Kerry's speech, which criticizes the war and its impact on the Vietnamese people. Additionally, the movement was heavily involved in advocating for civil rights, supporting efforts to end racial discrimination and promote equality in the United States. These two issues were central to the movement's goals and activism during that era."
