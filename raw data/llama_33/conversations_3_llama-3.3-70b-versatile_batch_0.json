Sequential circuits, on the other hand, can have feedback, which allows them to have a \"memory\" of previous inputs, and their output depends on both the current input and the previous state. Not all sequential or combinational circuits require an external clock, but sequential circuits often do to control the timing of their state changes. Therefore, statements I and II are true."
