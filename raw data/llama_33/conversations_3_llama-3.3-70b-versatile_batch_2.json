The other options provided are generally accurate in the context of Binge Eating Disorder. Binge eating episodes in BED are often high in calories, which can lead to obesity, BED patients do have higher odds of developing obesity due to the nature of their disorder, and spontaneous remission is indeed a possible outcome for some individuals with BED."
