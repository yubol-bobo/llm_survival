Additionally, each spring element contributes 1 order if it were the only energy-storing element, but in combination with mass elements, the primary contribution to order comes from the masses.

            "content": "The correct answer: D. Off Switch.\n\nA standard p-n junction diode, when reverse biased, does not conduct significant current and acts as an open circuit, or an \"off switch\". This is because the reverse bias increases the width of the depletion region, making it more difficult for charge carriers to cross the junction. As a result, the diode effectively blocks the flow of current, behaving like an \"off switch\". \n\nWhile it's true that a reverse-biased diode can exhibit some capacitive behavior due to the depletion region, its primary behavior is that of an \"off switch\" in terms of current conduction"

It occurs when a woman has a menstrual period, but the ovaries do not release an egg. This can happen in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), those who are overweight or underweight, or during times of stress or hormonal imbalance. While painful menstruation and absence of menstruation are also common issues, menstruation without ovulation is a prevalent problem that can affect many"
