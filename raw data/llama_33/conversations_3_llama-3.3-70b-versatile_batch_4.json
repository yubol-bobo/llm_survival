This diffraction allows sound waves to bend around obstacles and be heard from around the corner. In contrast, light waves have a much shorter wavelength and do not diffract as much, making it more difficult to see around a corner. The ability of sound waves to diffract and bend around obstacles is the primary reason why sounds can be heard from around a corner, but light cannot be seen."

Deindividuation is a psychological state where individuals lose their sense of self and personal responsibility, often due to anonymity. The use of head coverings and sunglasses can enhance this anonymity, leading to a reduction in self-awareness and personal accountability, which is a key characteristic of deindividuation. This concept is well-established in social psychology and is directly related to the scenario described."

Systematic desensitization is a behavioral therapy technique that involves teaching the client to relax and manage their anxiety response while imagining or being in the feared situation. The therapist's instruction to relax, close his eyes, and breathe slowly is a common relaxation technique used in systematic desensitization to help the client cope with anxiety.\n\nSystematic desensitization typically involves creating a hierarchy of feared situations and gradually exposing the client to each situation"

What the event will be is also beyond the reach of my foresight. We have errors to correct. We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation. Experience has taught us that men will not adopt and carry into execution measures the best calculated for their own good without the intervention of a coercive power. I do not conceive that we can exist long as a nation without having lodged somewhere a power which will pervade the whole Union in as energetic a manner as the authority of the state governments extends over the several states. . . .\n\"What astonishing changes a few years are capable of producing. I am told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical form of government without horror. . . . What a triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing ourselves, and that systems founded on the basis of equal liberty are merely ideal and fallacious. . . .\"\n—George Washington, letter to John Jay, August 1, 1786\nBased on the context of the letter, which of the following most closely describes the meaning of Washington's phrase, \"We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature\"? A. Contemporary Deist spiritual beliefs were misguided in that they abandoned the Calvinist notions of \"original sin.\", B. The United States had overestimated the good will and honor of Great Britain in terms of following the stipulations of the Treaty of Paris (1783)., C. The U.S. Army misread the willingness of American Indians in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions to live side-by-side with white settlers., D.
