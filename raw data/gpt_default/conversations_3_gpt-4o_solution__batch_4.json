Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n—Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nIn her speech, Eleanor Roosevelt alluded to the earlier threat to civil liberties created by which of the following? A. World War I, B. The New Deal, C. The Cold War, D. The Great Depression"

World War I is the historical context where civil liberties were notably threatened in the United States, with laws like the Espionage Act and Sedition Act restricting freedoms during that time. The New Deal, while significant, was not primarily about restricting civil liberties in the way that wartime measures were."

The passage more closely aligns with the sentiments behind the Immigration Act of 1924, which is not listed among the options.

Right?\n This question refers to the following information.\nI have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn response to the criticisms raised by Martin Luther and other Protestant reformers, the Roman Catholic Church made which of the following moves at the Council of Trent? A. It accepted the doctrine of predestination., B. It rejected saints as intermediaries., C. It accepted scriptures in the vernacular., D. It rejected salvation based on faith alone."

It rejected salvation based on faith alone.\n\nThe Council of Trent did not accept the doctrine of predestination as understood by Protestant reformers like John Calvin. Instead, it focused on clarifying Catholic teachings, including the rejection of salvation by faith alone, emphasizing the necessity of both faith and works. The doctrine of predestination, as accepted by some Protestant groups, was not adopted by the Catholic Church at the Council of Trent."

Instead, the Council reaffirmed the necessity of both faith and works for salvation, rejecting the Protestant emphasis on salvation by faith alone."
