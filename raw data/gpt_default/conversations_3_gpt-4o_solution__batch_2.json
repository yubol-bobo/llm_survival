Leaky ReLU \\(\\max\\{0.01x, x\\}\\) is not convex because it is a piecewise linear function with different slopes, which does not satisfy the definition of convexity.\n- C. The statement is false. A combination of ReLUs such as \\(ReLU(x) - ReLU(x-1)\\) is not convex because it creates a non-linear piecewise function that is not convex.\n- D. The statement is true.
