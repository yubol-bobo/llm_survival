The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld \"turn around\" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action? A. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster., B. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach., C. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy., D. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription."

The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld \"turn around\" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team.

The friend refused to answer any questions and was cited for contempt. After the friend left the witness stand, the prosecutor offered into evidence a transcript of the friend's testimony given at the student's preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, the friend testified under oath that he and the student were responsible for hazing the pledge and driving the victim against his will to the city. During the preliminary hearing, the friend was also cross-examined by the student's defense counsel. Over defense objections, the trial court admitted the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing. Thereafter, the student was convicted of violating the aforementioned hazing statute. The student appeals the conviction and contends that the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. As to this claim, the student's appeal will most likely be A. granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial., B. granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable., C. denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for crossexamination at the preliminary hearing., D. denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule."

This satisfies the requirements for admitting prior testimony under the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause when the witness is unavailable. Option D is incorrect because the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule typically applies to statements made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy, not to testimony given in court under oath."
