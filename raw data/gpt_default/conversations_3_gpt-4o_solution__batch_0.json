Since D is dominant, all offspring will be tall.\n\n3. **Inheritance of Flower Color:**\n   - The offspring can inherit either a W or w allele from the Ww parent and a w allele from the ww parent. This results in two possible genotypes for flower color: Ww (violet) and ww (white).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio of the progeny will be 1 tall violet (DdWw) : 1 tall white (Ddww). There will be no dwarf plants, so option C is not correct."
