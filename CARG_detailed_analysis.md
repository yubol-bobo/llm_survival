## ⚡ **4. Critical Vulnerability Points**

### **The "Death Traps" for CARG:**

1. **Prompt Type p8 + Prompt-to-Prompt Drift**
   - **Hazard Ratio: 1917.02** 
   - **Meaning**: Nearly guaranteed failure when this combination occurs
   - **Strategic Implication**: Must avoid p8-type adversarial patterns

2. **Medical Domain + Context-to-Prompt Drift**
   - **Hazard Ratio: 38.15**
   - **Meaning**: Medical questions with context drift are extremely dangerous
   - **Strategic Implication**: Medical domain requires special handling

3. **Prompt Type p2 + Prompt-to-Prompt Drift**
   - **Hazard Ratio: 40.69**
   - **Meaning**: Specific adversarial pattern causes major failures
   - **Strategic Implication**: p2-type attacks are highly effective

### **The "Safe Havens" for CARG:**

1. **Prompt Types p1, p3, p4, p7 + Prompt-to-Prompt Drift**
   - **Hazard Ratios: 0.0045 - 0.074**
   - **Meaning**: These combinations are extremely protective
   - **Strategic Implication**: CARG thrives under these adversarial patterns

2. **STEM Domain + Context-to-Prompt Drift**
   - **Hazard Ratio: 1.19**
   - **Meaning**: Minimal risk increase in STEM contexts
   - **Strategic Implication**: STEM is CARG's strongest domain

## 🧠 **5. Strategic Insights for CARG**

### **What Makes CARG Excel:**

1. **Selective Robustness**: Unlike other models with moderate vulnerabilities across all prompt types, CARG shows **extreme protection** against most patterns

2. **Sharp Risk Profile**: CARG has clear "safe" and "dangerous" zones, making its behavior highly predictable

3. **Domain Expertise**: Strongest in STEM, weakest in Medical domains

4. **Difficulty Adaptation**: Performs better on complex (high school/professional) rather than simple questions

### **CARG's Achilles' Heels:**

1. **p8-type adversarial prompts**: Near-certain failure
2. **Medical domain context shifts**: Major vulnerability
3. **p2-type prompt-to-prompt attacks**: High risk

### **Deployment Recommendations:**

1. **✅ Deploy CARG for**: STEM domains, high school/professional difficulty, p1/p3/p4/p7 adversarial contexts
2. **❌ Avoid CARG for**: Medical domains, p8/p2-type adversarial attacks
3. **🛡️ Monitor closely**: Context drift in medical conversations, prompt-to-prompt drift in p8/p2 scenarios

## 📊 **6. Comparative Advantage**

**Why CARG Wins Overall Despite Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Frequency Effect**: The "safe haven" prompt types (p1, p3, p4, p7) are more common than the "death trap" types (p8, p2)

2. **Extreme Protection**: When CARG is safe, it's **extremely safe** (HR < 0.1), providing massive survival advantage

3. **Predictable Failures**: CARG's failures are concentrated in specific, identifiable patterns, making them avoidable through careful prompt design

4. **Domain Balance**: Strong performance in STEM and reasonable performance in other domains offset medical domain weakness

---

**🏆 Conclusion**: CARG's superiority comes from **extreme specialization** rather than general robustness. It has learned to be nearly invulnerable to most adversarial patterns while accepting concentrated vulnerability in specific scenarios. This makes it highly suitable for controlled deployment environments where dangerous prompt types can be filtered out.
